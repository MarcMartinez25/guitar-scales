# Guitar Scale Visualizer

An app that helps guitarists visualize scales across the fretboard.

## Features

- Interactive fretboard visualization
- Multiple scale types (Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Blues, etc.)
- Various tuning options (Standard, Drop D, etc.)
- Root note highlighting
- Clear scale pattern display

## Usage

1. Select a scale type from the dropdown (e.g., Major, Minor, Pentatonic)
2. Choose your desired key (e.g., C, G, A)
3. Select your preferred tuning
4. The fretboard will display:
   - Root notes in dark blue
   - Scale notes in light blue
   - Clear fret markers and string labels

## Roadmap
Things I would like to add in the future:
- microphone access to highlight current note playing
- more scales and tunings
- add more instruments (ie: banjo, bass)
- pattern focus ability
- mix scales
- show multiple scales

## Development

This project uses:
- Next.js for the framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
